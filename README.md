# Space-X-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
PROJECT BACKGROUND AND CONTEX
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, and much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. The project task is to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully, we can determine the cost of a launch.
